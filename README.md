# Python NewsFeed

## The purpose of this project is to refactor the code of a previous project called Just Tech News. This application was initially created with Node.js on the backend, while using Handlebars.js to deliver the HTML and data. In this project, Python will be used to replace Node.js on the backend and Python Flask will be used to replace Handlebars.js
